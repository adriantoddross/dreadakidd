# Drea Da Kidd
> An accessible, performant, progressively enhanced music artist website (based on [tygamusic.com](tygamusic.com/)) for music artist [Drea Da Kidd](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-s6iMLJQVDGXMN5Eb5IcwQ).

In early 2020, my friend Drea Da Kidd reached out to me with a lot of ideas. Ultimately, he was ready to start laying down the foundation necessary to become a successful music artist. At one point, he even expressed interest in me being his manager, but I decided to offer help in my area of expertise: frontend development.

## How This Website Came To Be

Drea had reasonable expectations and wasn't asking for much. He wanted a site that looked like [tygamusic.com](tygamusic.com/). That was it. He'd provide the assets and copy for anything I needed. I even put together a design brief, but it wasn't necessary. This was one of the simplest things I'd ever agreed to!

I'd made wireframes and mockups based on our reference site, and everything was fine until I was actually ready to start coding. Everything was fine until I inspected the HTML of our reference site... ðŸ˜°

## Goals of This Project

As a music artist, you want to reach as many fans as you can. This inspired to design a website that was simple and legible, inclusive, and accessible to as many users as possible. More than anything, I realized that music fans can be *anywhere* at *any time*.

Semantic HTML and progressive enhancement are an integral part of search engine optimization, but they also help users with spotty connections, older devices, and users with assistive technology. Since this is a simple site meant to redirect fans to Drea's latest single, project, or upcoming show dates, it was essential that I use every advantage I can to make sure a user always sees *something*.

- Minimal first paint time (thanks to progressive enhancement)
- Mobile first, responsive web design
- Properly serve users the best image based on the view width
- Semantic markup
- Refrain from using browser incompatible code, or polyfill & enhance progessively

### Stretch Goals

- Add a service worker and turn this into a progressive web app or, alternatively
- turn this into a [neo.js project](https://github.com/neomjs)

**This project is still a work in progress, so this readme will be updated as I build out the website.**
